âš› Enhances the reliability of managing app lifecycles across iOS and Android platforms, ensuring consistent behavior regarding `foreground` and `background` states.

It implements the [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) for **Android** and falls back to the [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) for **iOS**.

## Why Use This?

The original [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) API provided by React Native behaves differently between Android and iOS, particularly regarding the `background` state:

- On iOS, the `background` state signifies that the entire app is in the background.
- On Android, the `background` state indicates that the React Native Activity is in the background, which might not necessarily mean the entire app is in the background.

By using `react-native-applifecycle`, you can handle these differences seamlessly across both platforms, ensuring that the state `background` will be dispatched only when the entire app is in background.

## Install

Install dependency package
```bash
yarn add react-native-applifecycle
```
Or
```bash
npm i -S react-native-applifecycle
```

## Usage

The App Lifecycle API is compatible with the original [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate).

### Subscribing to the `change` listener:

```tsx
import {AppLifecycle} from 'react-native-applifecycle';

const App = () => {

  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = AppLifecycle.addEventListener('change', state => {
      // do something
    });

    return () => listener.remove();
  }, []);

  return <View />;
}

export default App;
```

### Getting the current state with `hook`:

```tsx
import {useAppLifecycle} from 'react-native-applifecycle';

const App = () => {
  const currentLifecycle = useAppLifecycle();

  // do something

  return <View />;
}

export default App;
```

For more details, see the [Sample Project](https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-applifecycle/blob/main/Sample/App.tsx).

## Lifecycle States

- `active` - The app is running in the foreground
- `background` - The app is running in the background. The user is either:
    - in another app
    - on the home screen
- [iOS] `inactive` - This is a state that occurs when transitioning between foreground & background, and during periods of inactivity such as entering the multitasking view, opening the Notification Center or in the event of an incoming call.

For more information, see [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate#app-states).

## Events

### `change`
    
This event is received when the app state has changed. The listener is called with one of the current app state values.

### `memoryWarning`, `focus`, `blur`, etc

Falls back to [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate#events)

## Methods

### `addEventListener()`

```ts
static addEventListener(
  type: AppStateEvent,
  listener: (state: AppStateStatus) => void,
): NativeEventSubscription;
```

Sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event type on Lifecycle occurs. Valid values for `eventType` are listed above. Returns the `EventSubscription`.

## Properties

### `currentState`

```ts
static currentState: AppStateStatus;
```

## Jest mock

```js
jest.mock('react-native-applifecycle/dist/AppLifecycle', () => require('react-native-applifecycle/jest/AppLifecycleMock'));
```

## Limitations

In development mode, some lifecycle events may not trigger as expected due to how React Native handles backgrounding and hot reloading during development. Read more https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-applifecycle/issues/13#issuecomment-3065908934
